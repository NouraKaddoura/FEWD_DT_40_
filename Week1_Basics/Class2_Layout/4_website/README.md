# FEWD Week #1: HTML/CSS Basics


<br>

---


### Description


For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter_code/images) with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter_code/sample_copy.txt) that you can use.

### Technical Requirements

- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Show images using `img` tags including unique `alt` attributes

- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

#### Bonus

- Slides from [class 1](../01_html_basics/slides.md) and [class 2](../02_css_basics/slides.md).

Here are examples of a simple "About" and "Portfolio" page that fulfill the assignment requirements:

### Evaluation / Submission

Students will create a new repository on GitHub called "homework-portfolio" and push their code to this new repository when they are ready to submit. The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2).  The maximum possible score on this assignment is 16/16.
