Layout Challenges
=================

The PDF includes "gray box" drawings of page layouts that are increasingly difficult to achieve using CSS. These are intended to be used after introducing students to the basics of `float` and `clear`. Don't belabor the way either of these work in any significant detail. There are blog posts to recommend for students who would like a deeper understanding, and these exercises are meant to help them explore the basics and practice to develop a better intuitive sense for how `float` and `clear` work.

If you'd like, use the first two layouts as sample layouts to work through in a demonstration to explain the basics to the class. If used this way, I still recommend asking the students to repeat those two when they start their own work, as this will validate to them that they are building an understanding and still be useful practice before they work on the harder examples.

This activity is meant to tie into an overall emphasis in the course on process and building an intuitive sense of abstraction. The particulars of what might go inside each block are unimportant while trying to get the layout to flow properly. I'll leave it to you to think about how you want to introduce students to that notion for now.

The intention is to later connect this type of work to design as an output, and a more completely-built page as an output. This ties into the process of breaking down a comp for the purposes of building a page designed through a more traditional process, and also to the process of working on discrete sections of HTML & CSS until the full page is built out, while thinking modularly.

This is an aspect of the course that is ongoing in its evolution, and we would welcome any additional insight. :)

There are no notes for the students relating to this set of challenges, just give them the PDF, get them started, and let them go. Finishing the assignment can make for good weekend homework. For feistier students, you can either draw a more complicated layout of the board quickly for them, or invite them to find a site they like with a complicated layout, draw the gray boxes for it themselves, and built out the layout in HTML and CSS.

Please also note that we are not providing finished HTML and CSS for these exercises. I've found that HTML and CSS style can vary considerably from instructor to instructor, so please feel free to take your own approach to these quick layout wireframes. Please be mindful that your approach here should probably be informative to approaches taken later on in the course, especially when making responsive layouts.
