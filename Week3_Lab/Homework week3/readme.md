### Week 3 HTML/CSS Lab

This week we continue to learn how to think like a Front-End Web Developer. The next to lessons are dedicated to in class lab time, where students practice and review HTML/CSS.


### Description 


You will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

- Use in-line-block or floats in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the readme and according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages

#### Bonus

- Link the "Blog" link in the header to the page you've built for this assignment

- Up for a real challenge? Use ```<script>``` tags in your HTML and see if you can look up with javascript how to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."
